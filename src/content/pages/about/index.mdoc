# Hey, I'm Rohid. I'm a programmer, designer and solopreneur

I'm a Software Developer from Bangladesh. I craft web and mobile apps with modern techs such as&nbsp;React,&nbsp;Next JS,&nbsp;React Native,&nbsp;Flutter,&nbsp;and many more.

I also maintain some open-source projects like&nbsp;codetoimg.com&nbsp;and&nbsp;supabotai.com. See all the projects that I have worked on&nbsp;here. Remember, as a developer your 70% work stays in your computer 🙂.

I also (tweet/post) ✍️ on (𝕏/Twitter) about tech and programming. Hit me up at&nbsp;[@rohiddev](https://twitter.com/rohiddev).
