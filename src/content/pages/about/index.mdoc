# Hey, I'm Rohid. I'm a programmer, designer and solopreneur

I'm a Software Developer from Bangladesh. I craft web and mobile apps with modern tech such as&nbsp;[**React**](https://react.dev/),&nbsp;[**Next JS**](https://nextjs.org/),&nbsp;[**Astro**](https://astro.build/),&nbsp;[**Expo**](https://expo.dev/),&nbsp;[**Solid JS**](https://solidjs.com/),&nbsp;[**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/),&nbsp;[**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/)&nbsp;and many more.

I also maintain some open source projects like&nbsp;[**codetoimg.com**](https://codetoimg.com/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[**supabotai.com**](https://supabotai.com/). See all the projects that I have worked on&nbsp;[**here**](http://localhost:3000/projects). Remember, as a developer your 70% work stays in your computer üôÇ.

I also (tweet/post) ‚úçÔ∏è on (ùïè/Twitter) about tech and programming. Hit me up at&nbsp;[**@rohiddev**](https://twitter.com/rohiddev).
