Hi guys 👋

In this video tutorial, I am going to implement this awesome Shopping app UI 😍. It is a modern UI. It has lots of layout elements to play with and you will learn a lot by implementing this UI in react native. It has grid layouts, a masonry list, a bottom sheet, blurred background, and lots of interesting things. This is a perfect UI for you to practice on.

We will learn how to implement React navigation with TypeScript and nested navigation 😎, How to use React Native Reanimated 🔥, how to add a react-native masonry list view 🖼️, how to add a grid layout in react native 🚀, and also a custom theme 🎨.

I hope you will find this react native shopping UI tutorial video help full and that you learn lots of things from this video.
