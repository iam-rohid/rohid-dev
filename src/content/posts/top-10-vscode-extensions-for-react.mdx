## ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets Extension

JavaScript and React/Redux snippets in ES7+ with Babel plugin features for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Install It](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets)

## Prettier - Code formatted

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

## Highlight Matching Tag

This extension highlights matching opening and/or closing tags. Optionally it also shows the path to tag in the status bar. Even though VSCode has some basic tag matching, it's just that - basic. This extension will try to match tags anywhere: from tag attributes, inside of strings, any files, while also providing extensive styling options to customize how tags are highlighted.

## change-case

A wrapper around [node-change-case](https://github.com/blakeembrey/node-change-case) for Visual Studio Code. Quickly change the case of the current selection or current word.

## EditorConfig for VS Code

This plugin [attempts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig#known-issues) to override user/workspace settings with settings found in `.editorconfig` files. No additional or vscode-specific files are required. As with any EditorConfig plugin, if `root=true` is not specified, EditorConfig [will continue to look](https://editorconfig.org/#file-location) for an `.editorconfig` file outside of the project.

[Install It](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
