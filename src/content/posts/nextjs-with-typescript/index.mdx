## Introduction ðŸ¥¸

**TypeScript** is powerful in every way ðŸ‘€. It brings type definition in **JavaScript** ðŸ¤¯. **TypeScript** helps us and IDE's finding bugs while we are coding. For that, we can deploy our websites/services without any hidden bugs for the most time. I think it is the default go-to language for modern development. At least that's what I think.

Similarly, **Next.js** is also powerful cause it is behind the scene **React**, which is one of the popular plus powerful JavaScript front-end framework out there. It also brings server-side rendering in **React** ðŸ¤¯. And for this server-side rendering feature now we react developers can develop SEO-friendly websites with **React** which is awesome.

In this blog, we are going to see how easily we can implement **TypeScript** into a **nextjs** project. Are you excited? It's super simple to do trust me ðŸ˜‰

## Here is how to do it

To use typescript in our next js project we have to create a nextjs project first or if you already have a project then it's pretty easy to upgrade your project to TypeScript.

To use TypeScript you need to install or add(if you are using yarn) typescript dependency plus types for react dependency. After that just by changing the file extensions from `.js` to `.tsx` next js will automatically recognize you are using typescript and it will generate a config file for `tsconfig.json` for your project.

Let's see the process step by step

### Step 1 - Create a next.js project

The easiest way to create a next.js project is to use the `create-next-app` command.

```bash
npx create-next-app my-project-name
```

This will create a nextjs project for you. Here is the file structure

### Step 2 - Add extra dependencies for typescript

For TypeScript to work you have to install `typescript` as a dev dependency plus types for React and react-dom in your project. To do this just simply run this command

```bash
// if you are using yarn
yarn add -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
// if you are using npm
npm i -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
```

### Step 3 - Change extensions from `.js` to `.tsx`

Finally, we can just change all the extensions from `.js` to `.tsx`.

It should look like this

### Step 4 - All done! run your project ðŸŽ‰

All done. Run your project.

```bash
// if you are using yarn
yarn dev
// if you are using npm
npm run dev
```

While running, next js will detect that you are using TypeScript and it will generate a config file for your project in the root directory `tsconfig.json`.

## All done ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

All done! We are successfully converted our JavaScript base nextjs project to a TypeScript project. Awesome job guys.

I hope this blog helped you with implementing TypeScript into your nextjs project ðŸ˜Š
